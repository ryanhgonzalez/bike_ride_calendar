# 🚴 Houston Bike Ride Events Calendar

A centralized, easy-to-use, modern web app for discovering bike riding events happening across Houston.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Houston Bike Ride Events Calendar** is a responsive web application designed to bring all Houston-area group rides into one place. Instead of relying on word of mouth, scattered social media posts, or browsing multiple pages, riders can browse a single calendar and instantly see what's happening on any day of the month.

The calendar automatically displays the **current month**, with each ride event clearly shown on the appropriate day. Clicking an event opens a detailed view with information such as time, location, and event organizer social media handles.

## 🎯 Purpose

Houston's biking community is large and active, but ride information is often spread across:
- Instagram posts  
- Group chats  
- Facebook groups  
- Word of mouth  

This makes it easy for riders—especially new ones—to miss out.

**This app solves that problem.**

By aggregating rides into a single calendar:
- Riders can easily find events happening today, tomorrow, or later this month.
- Organizers gain a single place to promote their events.
- The Houston cycling community becomes more connected and accessible.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML** — overall page structure  
- **CSS** — modern, responsive layout and styling  
- *(Future-ready for JavaScript if event data becomes dynamic)*

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Planned)

- Ride categories & filtering  
- Map integration for meetup locations  
- Weekly and daily calendar views  
- User-submitted event forms  
- Automated event imports from organizer social media  
- Notifications or calendar subscription features
